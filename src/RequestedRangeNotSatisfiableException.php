/**
 * 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable
 *
 * A server SHOULD return a response with this status code if a request
 * included a Range request-header field (section 14.35), and none of
 * the range-specifier values in this field overlap the current extent
 * of the selected resource, and the request did not include an If-Range
 * request-header field. (For byte-ranges, this means that the first-
 * byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values were greater than the
 * current length of the selected resource.)
 *
 * When this status code is returned for a byte-range request, the
 * response SHOULD include a Content-Range entity-header field
 * specifying the current length of the selected resource (see section
 * 14.16). This response MUST NOT use the multipart/byteranges content-
 * type.
