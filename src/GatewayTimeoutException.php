 * 504 Gateway Timeout

 * The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a
 * timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g.
 * HTTP, FTP, LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed
 * to access in attempting to complete the request.

 *    Note: Note to implementors: some deployed proxies are known to
 *    return 400 or 500 when DNS lookups time out.
