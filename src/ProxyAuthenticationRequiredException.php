/**
 * 407 Proxy Authentication Required
 *
 * This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the
 * client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. The proxy MUST
 * return a Proxy-Authenticate header field (section 14.33) containing a
 * challenge applicable to the proxy for the requested resource. The
 * client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Proxy-Authorization
 * header field (section 14.34). HTTP access authentication is explained
 * in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication".
