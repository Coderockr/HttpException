/**
 * 503 Service Unavailable
 *
 * The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a
 * temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication
 * is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after
 * some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a
 * Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD
 * handle the response as it would for a 500 response.

 *    Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a
 *    server must use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers may wish
 *    to simply refuse the connection.
