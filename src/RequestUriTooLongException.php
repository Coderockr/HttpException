/**
 * 414 Request-URI Too Long
 *
 * The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI
 * is longer than the server is willing to interpret. This rare
 * condition is only likely to occur when a client has improperly
 * converted a POST request to a GET request with long query
 * information, when the client has descended into a URI "black hole" of
 * redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of
 * itself), or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to
 * exploit security holes present in some servers using fixed-length
 * buffers for reading or manipulating the Request-URI.
